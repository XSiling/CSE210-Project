# Follower Recommendation Rendering Functions Documentation

## Overview

This documentation details the functions used to fetch image data URLs and to render follower recommendation cards within the application.

## Functions

### `fetchImageDataUrl(imageUrl, callback)`

This function is responsible for fetching a base64 encoded data URL of an image from a given URL. It uses the `fetch` API to make a network request and convert the image at the provided URL to a data URL.

- **Parameters**:
  - `imageUrl` (String): The source URL of the image to be converted.
  - `callback` (Function): A callback function that will receive the data URL upon successful conversion or `null` in case of an error.

- **Usage**:
  - The function should be called whenever an image needs to be displayed in a data URL format. This is particularly useful for inline images and for circumventing cross-origin issues.

### `renderFollowerRecommendation(recommendationData)`

Generates an HTML card element that visualizes the recommendation data for a follower. The function dynamically creates the structure of the card and populates it with data including the avatar, name, username, follower count, following count, and a biography.

- **Parameters**:
  - `recommendationData` (Object): An object containing the data for the follower recommendation.

- **Returns**:
  - A `section` element with the class `follower-card` that contains the structured data and elements representing the follower.

- **Usage**:
  - This function is intended to be called when there is a need to display follower recommendations to the user. It is designed to work with dynamic data and should be called after fetching the necessary recommendation data from the backend.
