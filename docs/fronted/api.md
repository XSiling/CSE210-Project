### API Keys Module Documentation

#### Overview

This module is designed to manage the API endpoints for Flask and Node.js servers. It centralizes the URLs, facilitating easy updates across different environments, such as development and production.

#### Module Contents

- `flaskApikey`: A string holding the Flask server's URL.
- `nodeApikey`: A string holding the Node.js server's URL.

#### Usage

The `flaskApikey` and `nodeApikey` are exported, making them available for import in other parts of the application, particularly where API interactions are necessary.

#### Example

How to import and use in another JavaScript module:

\```javascript
import { flaskApikey, nodeApikey } from 'path_to_this_module';

// Using the API keys
console.log(flaskApikey); // Logs: "http://localhost:5000"
console.log(nodeApikey); // Logs: "http://localhost:3000"
\```

#### Important Considerations

- **Environment-Specific Values**: The current default values for `flaskApikey` and `nodeApikey` target localhost, suitable for development. For production deployment, these should be updated to match the actual service URLs.
- **Security**: Be cautious not to include sensitive information in these keys, particularly in client-side code.

#### Best Practices

- Keeping configuration data like server URLs in a separate module is good practice, as it eases endpoint management.
- Use environment variables or a configuration management system to handle different values for various environments (development, testing, production).
