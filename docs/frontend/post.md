# Image and Post Rendering Functions Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed information about JavaScript functions utilized for fetching image data URLs and rendering recommendation posts in the application.

## Functions

### `fetchImageDataUrl(imageUrl, callback)`

Fetches a data URL representation of an image from a given image URL. It makes a network request to the server which converts the image into a data URL and returns it.

- **Parameters**:
  - `imageUrl` (String): The URL of the image to be converted.
  - `callback` (Function): A callback function that handles the response. It receives the data URL as a parameter.

- **Usage**:
  - This function is called when an image needs to be displayed as a data URL instead of a direct link. This is often necessary for cross-domain images or for images that need to be displayed inline.

### `renderRecommendationPost(recommendAccount)`

Creates and returns an HTML element (`article`) structured as a post card that displays information about a recommended account.

- **Parameters**:
  - `recommendAccount` (Object): An object containing details of the recommended account, such as username, email, avatar, content, timestamps, and media attachments.

- **Returns**:
  - An `article` element with class `post-card` that contains the structured information of the recommended account.

- **Usage**:
  - Call this function when you need to display a list of recommended posts based on the fetched data. The function uses `fetchImageDataUrl` to retrieve and display images.
